## How To Use

#### Clone the repository:

```
    git clone https://github.com/ttomczak3/BookListerCMS.git
```

Once you clone the repository into your VSCode, you'll need to create your database next. You'll need MySQL downloaded when creating the database and the tables for the project. The SQL files for the tables are in the project file under the webbooks folder. When you finish creating your database, you'll need to create a PDO in the dbConnect.php file.
